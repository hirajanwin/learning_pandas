# Learning Pandas

This repository documents my one week self-directed crash course in Pandas. You can find my blog post where I go over the project in more details [here](https://kellyfoulk.herokuapp.com/post/3).

1. First, I worked through the Pandas documentation, including their 10 Minutes to Pandas page. I had never used Jupyter notebooks, but fortunately I decided to make the switch about halfway through this section of my 'course.'
2. Second, I worked through the 100 Pandas Puzzles notebook (I attempted to rely more on the documentation than on Stack Overflow).
3. Third, I downloaded a the Denver 2010 Census dataset from denvergov.org. I practiced cleaning, indexing into and visualizing data.
