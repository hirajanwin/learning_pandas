# Learning Pandas

This repository documents my self-directed one week crash course in Pandas.

1. First, I worked through the Pandas documentation, including their 10 Minutes to Pandas page.
2. Second, I worked through the 100 Pandas Puzzles notebook (I attempted to rely more on the documentation than on Stack Overflow).
3. Third, I downloaded a the Denver 2010 Census dataset from denvergov.org. I practiced cleaning, indexing into and visualizing data.
